# Ahri Scene Editor

Is a scene editor written with Libgdx. The purpose of the editor is to support multiple engines (Write custom importers) however
it will begin as a LibGDX only editor.

It will (hopefully) feature in release:

* Custom Properties (this is actually why I started this project; custom properties = infinity and beyond!)

* Script editor

* Auto reload files

* Translation, rotation and scaling

* Scene properties

* Objects such as camera, particles and lights

* load custom shaders

# IN DEVELOPMENT

The code is horrible right now and I'm sorry for that. It will be cleaned up (alot) when everything starts to come together.
